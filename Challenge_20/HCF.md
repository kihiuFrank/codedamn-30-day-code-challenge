# HCF

Task HCF or Highest Common Factor is the greatest number which divides each of the two or more numbers.

1. Create a function hcf(num1,num2) . This hcf() will take two arguments uint type number1 and number2.
2. The hcf() will find the of number1 and number2. For Example - If num1 = 60 num2 = 75 then hcf() will return 15. If num1 = 31 and num2 = 23 then hcf() will return 1.

Note - Function will be public.
