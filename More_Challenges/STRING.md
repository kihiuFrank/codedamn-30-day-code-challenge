# Program on String

\*\*Task-

To complete this challenge, you have to create a string type state variable and initialised it with "Yes solidity is fun" and then you have to create a function returnStateVariable( ) which returns the value of the created state variable .

In the same way you have to create a string type local variable and initialised it with "Yes solidity is exciting" and then you have to create a function returnLocalVariable( ) which returns the value of the created local variable.

You can do this :-)
