## Modifier

Task

To complete this challenge, do the following.

Create a constructor to set the owner of the contract.
2)Create two modifiers -

onlyOwner( ) - Its check whether function is being called by the owner or not. If not throw error "You are not owner".
onlyEven(uint256 val ) - To check whether the val is even or not. If not even then throw an erorr "Value is odd".
3)Then create a function check(uint256 val) which returns the value of the val variable. Use both of the modifiers created above for this function.

You can do this :-)
