# Fixed Byte Size Array

Task

To complete this challenge, do the following.

1. Create a bytes1 type state variable and initialized it with "a";

2. Create a setBytesArray ( ) with one argument of bytes1 type. And set the value of the created state variable with the value passed as an argument to the function.

3. Then create another function getByteValue ( ) which returns the value of the state variable.

You can do this :-)
