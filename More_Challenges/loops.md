## Loops

Task-

To complete this challenge, you have to create a uint type array and initialised it with 10,20,30,40,50 and then you have to create two functions

i) createLoop( ) - which doubles all the elements of the array using loops.

ii)returnArray( ) - which returns all the elements of the array.

You can do this :-)
