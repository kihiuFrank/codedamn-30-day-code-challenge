# Design Patterns

Design patterns have proven to be the go-to solution for many common programming scenarios. They are not only generic, but also easy to extend and tweak to one’s needs.

We will look at the following patterns:

1. Factory Pattern
2. Mapping Iterator
3. Sending ether from contract: Withdrawal pattern
4. Name Registry
5. Re-entracy Attack
